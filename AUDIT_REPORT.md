# DApp Integration Audit Report

## 🔍 AUDIT SUMMARY

✅ **AUDIT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

Your perpetual exchange DApp has been fully audited and all critical integration issues have been **FIXED**.

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND & RESOLVED

### 1. ❌ **Contract Integration Failure** → ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem:** PerpetualManager and Vault contracts were not properly linked
**Solution:** 
- Redeployed contracts with proper linking
- Added authorization functions to both contracts
- Verified integration with automated tests

### 2. ❌ **Frontend Contract Address Mismatch** → ✅ **FIXED** 
**Problem:** Frontend was using old/incorrect contract addresses
**Solution:**
- Updated to latest deployed contract addresses
- Added PerpetualManager integration to frontend
- Fixed contract interaction logic

### 3. ❌ **Broken Business Logic** → ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem:** Frontend was bypassing PerpetualManager and calling Vault directly
**Solution:**
- Completely rewrote frontend to use proper perpetuals exchange architecture
- Users now interact with PerpetualManager for opening/closing positions
- Vault is only accessed indirectly through PerpetualManager

### 4. ❌ **Missing Contract Deployments** → ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem:** Only Vault was deployed, missing PerpetualManager and other contracts
**Solution:**
- Deployed complete contract suite to Sepolia testnet
- All contracts properly linked and functional

## 🎯 CURRENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS
